TODO / In development
---------------------

	- APIC virtualization (Partially implemented, needs testing & fixes)
	- UEFI support
	- Intel TXT support
	- AMD-V with NPT support
	- Nesting support (Some fixes needed and support for minor features)
	- Introspection
	- More documentation
	- Finish writing tests
	- Failsafe state (e.g. when an unexpected thing happens, turn off and restore state to a valid one.)

	See also Github issues.  Some of these features are unfortunately not
	(fully) implemented due to lack of hardware (support) or similar.
